title: Back to Work!

I won't go into the details by now (hopefully I will once I find a job!). But after having felt that maybe I could forget this beautiful routine I've came up with, I take one minute to right down the big steps involved in my search for a perfect new job!


## Draw my Arrow

Here, I want to thank [Tim Urban](https://www.ted.com/speakers/tim_urban) for his incredible work (thanks TED too for having put him on stage so I could discover him!). His whole [blog](https://waitbutwhy.com) is gold, but in this context I want to thank him for his article about [picking a career](https://waitbutwhy.com/2018/04/picking-career.html). As I said, I won't go into the details, but for sure I recommend you to read it... and to

> draw your arrow!

Note. *Actually* I did not come up with my yearnings octopus and hierarchy by simply walking and thinking about my life. It took me about three months and three carefully-orthogonally-targetted job applications to gather enough data to *feel* what are my yearnings (more material about experimenting your life instead of blindly following advise in this other [gem](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/the-cook-and-the-chef-musks-secret-sauce.html)).
But anyway, three fails one-of-which-rather-frustrating later, and thanks to the advises of one of the recruiter I met, I finally drew my arrow (and you are reading a tiny pixel of it right now!).

## Go from point A to the Star

Yeah another reference to the [pick a career](https://waitbutwhy.com/2018/04/picking-career.html) post. Man what a relief to finally have one clear hypothesis to experiment! Compared to the three months of "what do I want to do next" feelings, the "ok let's just work to get there" time is so much less stressful! Sure, I admit it can be a personal psychological bias (I am a fair expert in putting myself into a hand crafted routine of efficient work), but let's continue with that.

So for my profile, *point A* and the *Star* are typically close enough so I can hope to close the gap under 2-3 months (or at least I believe so :)) given my *pace* and *persistence*) (this terminology comes from the fabulous analysis of what's an achievable goal in the same [post](https://waitbutwhy.com/2018/04/picking-career.html)). And therefore I only have to craft a battle plan and stick to it.

And here it is, my routine I don't want to forget :)

1. Try to do a bit of each of the items in light gray everyday:

<div style="text-align: center;">
	<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2018-12-12-Back-To-Work/scheduleItems.png" style="width:300px;height:800px;">
</div>

2. Repeat

<div style="text-align: center;">
	<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2018-12-12-Back-To-Work/exampleWeek.png" style="width:614px;height:600px;">
</div>


So basically it is 40% networking, 60% skilling-up (a term I hope exists). And the more you network, the better you know what to learn to reach the *Star*, and the more opportunities come to you. Add to this the rule that "each contact must give you another contact", and you're set.

It's like two rays that are not exactly parallel: keep drawing them, until at some point the whole thing packs up into one point (ok it's not as cool a metaphor as I though).

Last point: do not be afraid of the work load! As the famous one said, "we overestimate what we can do in one hour, but we underestimate what we can do in one month" (or whatever motivates you). So yeah, I have to become a killer in data structures and algorithms to apply at Google *plus* in deep reinforcement learning to pretend being at the edge of research? No problem, just do this one daily chunk at a time - with some luck it will be sufficient for the interviews ;)
