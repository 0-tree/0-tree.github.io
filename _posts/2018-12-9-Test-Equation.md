title: Some Maths
---

OK let's try to write some maths.

First, I'd like to declare some inline variables: $$a = 7$$ and $$b=\sqrt{3}$$.

Now, if it's satisfactory, try an outline equation:

$$
b \leq a
$$

and a set of equations (first form):

$$
b \leq a \\
a \geq b \\
$$

(second form):

$$
\begin{align}
	b \leq a \\
	a \geq b \\
\end{align}
$$

Goog luck!
